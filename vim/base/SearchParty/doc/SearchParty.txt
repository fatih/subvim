 1. INTRODUCTION                                           *SearchParty-intro*

SearchParty provides extended search tools for Vim, such as searching for the
current visual selection (forwards and backwards), using the current visual
selection in a |:substitute|, performing literal (non regex) searches,
controlling current search highlight, highlighting arbitrary strings and
highlighting terms in :g// output.

 2. USAGE                                                  *SearchParty-usage*

Note: All of the default maps shown below can be overridden using the <Plug>
maps given.

Visual Searches~

SearchParty provides three visual mode search tools:

  *	Searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindNext

  #	Searches for the prior occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindPrior

  &	Starts a |:substitute| using the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindSubstitute

Literal Search~

SearchParty provides a normal mode literal text (without regular expression
magic) search:

  <leader>/  Prompts for a literal string to search for. This does NOT
             use a regular expression, so the characters you type here will be
             searched for literally without any magic interpretation.  The
             |<Up>| key scrolls through prior literal search history.
             <Plug>SearchPartyFindLiteral

Search Highlighting~

SearchParty provides the following normal mode search highlight tools:

  <C-L>      Temporarily clears search highlight and disables M.A.S.H.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightClear

  <C-BSlash> Toggles search highlighting.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightToggle

  <leader>*  Highlights all occurrences of |word| under the cursor.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWord

  <leader>g* Highlights all occurrences of |WORD| under the cursor.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWORD

Highlighting Print Command~

SearchParty provides a command, :P, which highlights the current search term
in its output. This command is especially useful as a |:global| subcommand:
>
  :g/something/P
<
Will show the matching lines with all occurrences of `something` on those
lines highlighted.

The :P command can be used as a standalone command too:
>
  :10,20 P
<
Will show lines 10 through 20, highlighting all occurrences of the current
search pattern.

Pattern Searches~

  <leader>ms Prompts for a pattern and sets the current search to that pattern
             without moving the cursor to the next match of that pattern.
             <Plug>SearchPartySetSearch

Matches~

  <leader>mm Prompts for a pattern and uses |matchadd()| to highlight all
             occurrences of that pattern in the current window.
             <Plug>SearchPartySetMatch

             There are six match patterns available, called SPM1-SPM6
             respectively. Using more than six matches will recycle through
             the SPM set, losing the previous match assigned to that slot.

             By default, the terminal palette colours #1-#6 are used for
             SPM1-SPM6. You can override these by providing lines like this in
             your ~/.vimrc file:
>
               hi SPM1 ctermbg=123
<
             NOTE: Do this after you have set your colorscheme.

                               *SearchPartyMatchDelete* *SearchPartyMatchList*
                                                    *SearchPartyMatchNumber*
             The following functions and commands are available for Search
             Party matches:
             * SearchPartyMatchDelete(number) - clear match by number
             * SearchPartyMatchList - list all match patterns
             * SearchPartyMatchNumber(number) - reset match number (1-6)

                                                            *SearchPartyMash*
M.A.S.H.~

Mash is a motion activated (lol - er, I mean, when you press n/N/#/*/g#/g*)
current search match highlighter. Breaking that down for you, it highlights
the match under the cursor differently to all the other matches (if you have
:set hlsearch activated). If you don't use hlsearch, then it will still
highlight the current match.

                                                     *SearchPartyMash-unmash*

Use CTRL-L to clear the current mash highlighting. This can be customised in
|mash-key-maps|.

                                                        *SearchPartyMash-fow*

Mash also provides a Fog of War mode where all non-matched text is greyed out.
Activate and disable (toggle) the FOW mode with <leader>mf . This can be
customised in  |mash-key-maps|.

Configuration                                 *SearchPartyMash-configuration*

Mash currently uses the built in Search and IncSearch highlight groups. Change
these if you want to use different colours or attributes. For example, if you
like the limelight:
>
  hi Search term=reverse ctermfg=White ctermbg=DarkGreen guifg=White guibg=DarkGreen
  hi IncSearch term=bold cterm=bold ctermfg=Black ctermbg=DarkGreen gui=bold guifg=LightYellow guibg=DarkGreen
<
If you use a dark-grey background, a black FOW is near invisible:
>
  hi MashFOW ctermfg=black ctermbg=none guifg=black guibg=none
<

Mash Key Maps                                      *SearchPartyMash-key-maps*

You can customise the actual key used to enable and disable Fog of War mode.
For example, to map the |mash-fow| enable key (which is, by default, mapped to
<leader>mf) to <leader>f, put the following in your ~/.vimrc :
>
  nmap <leader>f <Plug>MashFOWEnable
<
The following map targets are available for remapping in your ~/.vimrc :
>
  <Plug>MashFOWEnable              defaults to <leader>mf
  <Plug>MashFOWDisable             defaults to <leader>mF
  <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightClear  defaults to <c-l>
<

Ignorecase~

Mash respects the current 'ignorecase' option setting.

Issues                                          *SearchPartyMash-issues*

Mash fails if the search uses an offset other than start-of-pattern,
like:
>
     /foo/e
<
